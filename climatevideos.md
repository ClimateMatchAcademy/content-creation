Please use and don't change [this template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JqAIxbeDw0QdEiU_C-DjR7Ks9Tbxs6xNcNr-VSPt0Yo/edit#slide=id.p). We have           included boxes for your video and captions. The materials will eventually be published as CC-BY. Make sure your slides don't use any copyrighted material. For       example, we can't include figures from journals if they are not open access. Get in touch if you need help/guidance on this 

**Step 2: Record a rough cut of your lecture.**

**Step 3: Give us the slides/rough cut.** We will review and give you feedback.
