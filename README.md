## Content Creation

# Making videos
- Make your slides using [this template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mU5otRXJarz4HD-2kOFVSSedkXDUz4BHO6ISJIPOZz8/edit#slide=id.p). Please don't change the template! We have included boxes for your video and captions. The materials will eventually be published as CC-BY. 
- Make sure your slides don't use any copyrighted material. For example, we can't include figures from journals if they are not open access.
- Turn over to the slide review team at NMA to check them over.
- Once you get the okay, record your lecture. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_RHVZ-R0XPP634pIflgspR1dPSzHkkfc7uQ1vQ97p7g/edit#heading=h.2utdyzjhohx8) are instructions on how to record.
- Notation standards coming soon.


# Making tutorials
- We have a specific format for NMA tutorials, located [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/blob/master/organization/Neuromatch_Tutorial_Format.ipynb). Please adhere carefully to this format - the consistency reduces the cognitive load of students and allows them to focus on the material.
- [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11pmbsYszVDntBKL9xqdiXLBWje9OIA_Do6VgT_qPmak/edit#slide=id.p1) are some tips for how to make an accessible tutorial.
- Notation standards coming soon.
- Code standards/notebook examples for DL can be found in DL_Tutorial_Carpentry notebook.
- If you want a particular interactive demo but don't know how to make it, reach out! We can help.
- Once you finish the tutorials, we will review them and give you feedback for updates.
