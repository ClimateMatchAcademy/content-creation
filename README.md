## Content Creation

# Making videos
- Make your slides using [this template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mU5otRXJarz4HD-2kOFVSSedkXDUz4BHO6ISJIPOZz8/edit#slide=id.p). Please don't change the template! We have included boxes for your video (top right) and captions (large box at the bottom). Make sure to change the footer in the bottom left such that it has your name and topic there. Note that the template changed, because it previously had information in the bottom right of the footer, but this information has been removed to ease consistency across years. The materials will eventually be published as CC-BY. 
- Make sure your slides don't use any copyrighted material. For example, we can't include figures from journals if they are not open access. Please see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DBkFs1-q3Ehrbu5srDOaSi2GzEAoOe9D4WjSXRfuh1Y/edit?usp=sharing) for more information about copyrighted materials.
- Create accessible figures by using colorblind-friendly colors and by adding Alt text where possible. You can find instructions on increased accessibility [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w8WKcaZWl1qO5IJkGBWZZbmL29guFS18UZAljBCEWFk/edit?usp=sharing). 
- Turn over to the slide review team at NMA to check them over.
- Once you get the okay, record your lecture. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_RHVZ-R0XPP634pIflgspR1dPSzHkkfc7uQ1vQ97p7g/edit#heading=h.2utdyzjhohx8) are instructions on how to record.


# Making tutorials
- We have a specific format for NMA tutorials, located [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/blob/master/organization/Neuromatch_Tutorial_Format.ipynb). Please adhere carefully to this format - the consistency reduces the cognitive load of students and allows them to focus on the material.
- [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11pmbsYszVDntBKL9xqdiXLBWje9OIA_Do6VgT_qPmak/edit#slide=id.p1) are some tips for how to make an accessible tutorial.

- Code standards/notebook examples for DL can be found in DL_Tutorial_Carpentry notebook.
- If you want a particular interactive demo but don't know how to make it, reach out! We can help.
- Once you finish the tutorials, we will review them and give you feedback for updates.
